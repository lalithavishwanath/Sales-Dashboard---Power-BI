# üìä Sales and Profit Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the **Sales and Profit Analysis Dashboard** project! This repository showcases my data visualization skills using **Power BI**, where I transformed raw sales data into meaningful insights through interactive and visually compelling dashboards.

## üîç Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of sales and profit data across various dimensions such as **category**, **segment**, **region**, and **time**. The goal is to uncover trends, identify high-performing areas, and support data-driven decision-making.

## üìà Key Visualizations
